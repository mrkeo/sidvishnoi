      Bleu: a fully featured smart static website generator</h1>

    <blockquote><p>Bleu is a fully featured and extensible static website generator SSG that aims at reducing build time. It does so by building only what needs to be built, unlike other SSGs which build entire site from scratch. It only rebuilds updated files and takes into account the dependencies between different parts of a website.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Bleu was targetted to be used on large static websites (like blogs, news media, software documentation). I've used Jekyll earlier but building entire website from scratch didn't turn out fine for me. The incremental builds were not applicable on my website. (Jekyll is a really great software though &hearts;). So, I built Bleu so that it'll match my needs of faster regeneration. Bleu makes uses of NodeJS environment, so many web developers can use it (and extend it) really easily.</p>

    <p>Bleu is fully functional and I've been using it on my website : <a href="http://www.hoopsvilla.com">www.hoopsvilla.com</a>.</p>

    <p>By far, Bleu is my largest project (also in terms on codebase - around 30 KLOC). Sadly, I haven't released it yet as I think the codebase has maintenance issues. Also, I've been busy in other projects and college. I'll release it in public (open source) after a re-write (around October-November 2018).</p>

    <p>You should not Bleu in production yet, but you can try it out. We'll have a lot of new info about Bleu when I release it &#9786;.</p>

    <p>Although I haven't released Bleu, I've made it's documentation public (built using Bleu ofcourse). You can see the docs at: <a href="https://bleu-docs-temp.surge.sh/docs/welcome/">bleu-docs-temp.surge.sh/docs/</a>.</p>
