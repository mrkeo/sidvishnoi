    <p>This is a project I made during my Masters at Computer Applications course at Dept. of Computer Science, university of
      Delhi.
    </p>

    <p>The program lets you create a filesystem as a file and allows you to do file/directory operations in a Linux like terminal
      interface.
    </p>

    <p>It allows you to create files, create hierarchical directories, delete files and (attempt to) recover deleted files,
      along with operations like list directory, print directory tree, print working directory, change directory.</p>

    <p>Based on this, I created a file handling
      <a href="https://github.com/sidvishnoi/filesystem-assignment">assignment</a> (educative material) made to teach some ideas about file systems and gain user's experience in C++ file
      handling.</p>

    <p>The design makes use of a linked list and is somewhat similar to FAT. In the first few sectors, some space is reserved
      for pointers and status of other sectors.</p>
