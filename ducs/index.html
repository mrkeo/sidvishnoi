    <p>In an effort to involve students of DUCS (Dept. of Computer Science, University of Delhi) in web development and GitHub, I created an website for my college - <a href="https://www.ducs.in/">https://www.ducs.in/</a>.  The website is open-source and students collaboratively edit it's content.</p>

    <p>The website (at the time of writing) hosts Sankalan (annual tech fest of DUCS) and Srijan (annual magazine of DUCS). During Sankalan, we used - https://dashboard.ducs.in (deleted now to save server costs) to handle its ticketing system, quiz portals and admin interface.</p>

    <p>I later plan to inlcude an alumni network and placement related information on this website, ofcourse, with an open development environment.</p>

    <h2>Techinal Details</h2>

    <p>The main website - https://www.ducs.in/ is a static website. Now creating a static website isn't a very tough task, but maintaining a static website is. So in order to simplify maintanence part, I used a custom built static website generator using Gulp.js and some npm scripts. For templating I used Pug.js and the data was stored in .yaml files to allow easy editing.</p>

    <p>The site is hosted in three AWS S3 buckets (two for website - www and non-www and one for assets cdn). The buckets are accessed through two separate Cloudfront distributions. In order leverage strong HTTP caching, I converted static assets names to the checksums of their content. The cache is busted when the content changes.</p>

    <p>As S3 buckets do not allow easy access to pretty URLs, I made use of a tiny AWS Lambda @Edge function that makes sure users don't see 404s if they forgot to add a slash in URL.</p>

    <p>The SSL certificate on website is from AWS ACM.</p>

    <p>The dashboard website was built in PHP and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance with a load balancer in front of it. The MySQL database was hosted on AWS RDS.</p>

    <p>For the dashboard, I created my own framework on top on Symfony's HTTP foundation module. All requests are passed to a front-controller which processes those requests.</p>

    <p>To ease deployments, I made use of git and some shell scripting. Git was used so that I only upload the files that have changed (I've really slow internet).</p>

    <p>This project taught me a lot about AWS and SSH. It also connected some students to GitHub (as they updated the content of website)</p>
